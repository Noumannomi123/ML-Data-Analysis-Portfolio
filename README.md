# ML-Data Analysis Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my ML-Data Analysis Portfolio! I'm Nouman, a passionate data enthusiast with a keen interest in machine learning and data science. This portfolio showcases some of the projects I have worked on to analyze, visualize, and model trainings on various datasets.

## Author of the Projects
The original author of the project resources is Jose Portilla at Pierian Training. These Project and Exercise files are from the course "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" available on Udemy.

## Technologies Used
- Python (anaconda distribution)
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Nltk
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Cufflinks
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Visualization
Here are some visualizations from the projects:

## Challenges Faced
During the projects, I encountered several challenges that helped me grow as a data analyst and machine learning practitioner:

- **Understanding Column Selection:**
  In some cases, I found it challenging to determine which columns or features to select for analysis. The notebooks often presented questions directly, but I had to decide which data attributes were relevant for the task at hand.

- **Code Combination in Seaborn:**
  When using Seaborn for data visualization, I faced difficulties in figuring out the correct code combinations to achieve the desired results. It took time to experiment with different plot types, parameters, and data transformations to visualize the insights effectively.

- **Deciphering Result Requirements:**
  There were instances where the questions were straightforward, but understanding the specific result required was a challenge. It required a deeper dive into the data and careful consideration of the analysis objectives to ensure the results aligned with the project goals.

- **Resisting the Temptation of Solutions:**
  While solutions were available, I preferred not to rely on them unless absolutely necessary. This approach encouraged me to think critically, explore various techniques, and find my solutions, even if it meant spending extra time troubleshooting.

Despite these challenges, I embraced them as opportunities for learning and skill development. Through persistence, experimentation, and a willingness to explore new approaches, I was able to overcome these obstacles and achieve meaningful insights from the data.
